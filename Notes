||||----- Production Notes: Editing General -----||||

Need a way to generate a bug logo in the same place
every time.
Need a consistent way to indicate clip placement and
length.
Shotgun integration?

What opacity should the overlays be on? 40%?

script to get name of clip from marker
script for ciggy burn under clip name with interface
that shows which shots are approved/updated

Take shot length from markers and add to EDL file
	- Export markers
	- Convert markers to frame ranges
	- fill frame ranges

Colourspaces need to be matched BEFORE doing anything

Image overlay (For corner bugs) can be done in AME

||||	----- Production Notes: Team-Up -----	||||
Might be worth making animatic image planes in future
to ensure consistent framing.

Character Set-scale Size: 0.76~

PVS script that copies the current timeline key, goes
to the next key and pastes it (in one click)

Would love to have AutoHotKey installed so I can 
have custom keybinds

AHK Script Ideas:
 - Autoplayblast Cam Window
 - 

Rig notes:

-	Please use nurb poly sphere for controls instead
	of standard poly spheres
-	Include sets as part of rig (Some may be better
	suited to char sets)
		- Full set, all ctrls.
		- Hands
		- Face
		- Arms
		- Legs
		- Torso
		
-	Always have char name written in nurb at MAIN ctrl

-	Please add option to lock x,y axis on elbow.
	nice to have sometimes - in the way other times.
