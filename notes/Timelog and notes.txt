For the client one we stick to the plan we had and keep it pipeline step based. We'll need title cards and footer added for the shows.

These are just examples of what can be included for the steps, we need to pick our best work for each;

||||----- Production Notes: Editing General -----||||

A Change to the VS Script:
sends to versions folder
also sends to EDT / latest folder

Shotgun integration?

script for ciggy burn under clip name with interface
that shows which shots are approved/updated

Colourspaces need to be matched BEFORE doing anything


Extras that would improve my editing workflow:
Premiere Pro / AfterEffects Plugins

 - ProIO
	https://aescripts.com/pro-io/
	
	File management plugin, would allow automatic updating of frames when a new version is submitted, instead of having to update them all manually.
	
 - AfterCodecs
	https://aescripts.com/aftercodecs/
	
	More options for exporting codecs, could bring down size of files considerably
	
 - Voukoder
	https://www.voukoder.org/
	
	Same as above, but an open source version.

 - Rename and Change Toolkit
	https://aescripts.com/rename-and-change-toolkit-for-premiere/
	
	Often requirements change half way through an edit, and having to rename files in premiere is tedious and time consuming.

	
Standalone Programs:

 - AutoHotKey
	https://www.autohotkey.com/
	
	Premiere allows for custom keybinds for all of its fucntions, this pairs nicely with that, allowing custom input scripting so that multiple functions can be chained together.
	I use this to streamline processes in almost all of the production programs I use at home.
	
	
 - Windows-10-Virtual-Desktop-Switching-Shortcut https://github.com/nullpo-head/Windows-10-Virtual-Desktop-Switching-Shortcut
 
 
	
 - MPC-HC (K-Lite Codecs)
	https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm
	
	MPC-HC can play literally any file, Similar to VLC, but is more stable and lighter. Could do with a universal video player for playback of MOVs (which aren't in H.264) and other codecs that aren't natively supported by windows.
	
	
	
	
MACRO IDEAS:

PREMIERE:
	-	"v001-v009" button
			perhaps, ctrl+alt+shift + num?
	-	Save as, erase "v000", add "v001".
			Save as incremental for programs that dont have it
cpt	-	HOME, >x5, END, <x5, .
			importing at the correct frame range
			Could put a double click at the beginning too
cpt	-	Same as above ^ but more complicated
	Indicate how many clips there are and repeat the action that many times
	Select the first clip, and press the macro key
	SHIFT-O, >x5, END, <x5, ., CTRL-SHIFT-,, REPEAT
	
	
	-	D, CTRL+K, D, Del, \/, D, /\, Shift+w
			Assuming Audiolocked, select current track, make a cut, delete following, and fill next clip backwards.
			(CTRL+Down also selects the next clip, but only on the input track)
			(maybe a similar one for previous clip too)
		
cpt	-	ALT+DEL, TABx4, Space, Enter (audio)
		ALT+DEL, TABx2, Space, Enter (video)
			Delete all unused tracks: audio/video
	
cpt	-	(hover track) rClick, DOWNx4, Enter
			Delete hovered track
			
	-	CTRL+SHIFT+N, paste shotcode, next activation pastes following shotcode
			resetable shot counter, that allows you to select clips for the shot and hit one button to same next in the sequence

	-	ALT+A, ALT+D, find Shotnum, input next shotnum (005->010), end, bkspce, UPARROW, Enter, TABx4, DOWNARROW, UPARROW, ENTER
			Import next clip in sequence

GENERAL 
	- Passwords lol
	

||||	----- Production Notes: Team-Up -----	||||
Might be worth making animatic image planes in future
to ensure consistent framing.

Character Set-scale Size: 0.76~

PVS script that copies the current timeline key, goes
to the next key and pastes it (in one click)

Would love to have AutoHotKey installed so I can 
have custom keybinds

AHK Script Ideas:
 - Autoplayblast Cam Window
 - Premiere Copy, paste, rename with number script

Rig notes:

-	Please use nurb poly sphere for controls instead
	of standard poly spheres (so I can turn of poly selection)
-	Include sets as part of rig (Some may be better
	suited to char sets)
		- Full set, all ctrls.
		- Hands
		- Face
		- Arms
		- Legs
		- Torso
		
-	Always have char name written in nurb at MAIN ctrl

-	Please add option to lock x,y axis on elbow.
	nice to have sometimes - in the way other times.
	
-	Can we have a control to freeze sections of controls.
	Mostly just for doing facial, and freezing the body in place.

NOTES FOR PGO

Are we handling the final grade for the animation?
Are we handling the grade for the plates?
Either way it will help if I know which camera they will be using so I can match colourspaces
For delivery - are uncompressed frames best? We're able to deliver in either of TVNZ's preferred formats if it doesn't need to be edited further.
If it's being delivered uncompressed do you prefer a certain format? Movie file or frames? If there's no preference that's fine too.
Is only a 1080p version required? Would you also like another version up-scaled to a higher resolution? 
(TVNZ Broadcast and Heihei only need 1080p, but if it's also on a platform like Youtube I can optimize a higher res version to help keep the re-encode tidy)
Are we delivering on a shot-by-shot basis, or as a complete timed animation?
EG: [Shot 1-3] [Live Action] [Shot 4] [Live Action] [Shot 5-6]
							or
	[Shot 1][Shot 2][Shot 3] [Live Action] [Shot 4] [Live Action] [Shot 5][Shot 6]


Things that need documentation:

PSD - 3DSMax to Photoshop

Check the asset notes to see which shots require PSD
Open the Package Scene in 3DSMax and save it to PSD with Shotgun
Open ToolBox, then Open it again to properly load the PSD Script
